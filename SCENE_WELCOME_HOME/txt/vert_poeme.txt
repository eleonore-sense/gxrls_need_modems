                            I was doing my nails and    
                            sadly looked at the age   
                            my hands showed...then I   
                            remembered the work they  
                            have done, the children    
                            they have raised, the     
                            pleasure they have given    
                            and the things they have   
                            created. And I thought, be  
                            proud of every wrinkle in     
                            these hands, for they were   
                            earned, slowly over the        
                            years, one by one. -Lorrie
